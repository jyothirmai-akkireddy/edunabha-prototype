Project Report: Edunabha - A Modern Remote Classroom for Rural Colleges
1. Executive Summary
Edunabha is a comprehensive, multi-role digital learning platform designed to meet the unique challenges faced by rural colleges. It creates an integrated, interactive educational ecosystem with features tailored to environments with unreliable internet connectivity and limited infrastructure.
